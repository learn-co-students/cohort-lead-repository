### 1. Normal Distributions

Say we have check totals for all checks ever written at a TexMex restaurant. 

The distribution for this population of check totals happens to be normally distributed with a population mean of 20 dollars and population standard deviation of 3 dollars

#### 1a) Compute the z-score for a 26 dollar check. 

Complete the code in the function below and use it to calculate the answer


```python
def z_score(check_amt):
    """
    check_amt = the amount for which we want to compute the z-score
    """
    
    score = #your code here
    return score
```

#### 1b) Approximately what percentage of all checks are less than 26 dollars? Explain how you came to your answer.

You can answer this using the empirical rule or this [z-table](https://www.math.arizona.edu/~rsims/ma464/standardnormaltable.pdf).

### 2. Confidence Intervals

One night, a waiter gets 15 checks with a mean of 19 dollars and standard deviation of 3 dollars

#### 2a) Calculate the 95% confidence interval around the mean for this waitor's checks


```python
#Your code here
```

#### 2b) Interpret the result
