## Statistical Testing

You are working for a TexMex restaurant that recently introduced queso to its menu.

We have random samples of 1000 "no queso" order check totals and 1000 "queso" order check totals for orders made by different customers.

In the cell below, we load the sample data for you into the arrays `no_queso` and `queso` for the "no queso" and "queso" order check totals. Then, we create histograms of the distribution of the check amounts for the "no queso" and "queso" samples. 


```python
#run this cell without changes

# import the necessary libraries

#data manip
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd 
from scipy import stats

#viz
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#object import / export
import pickle

#jn command to run matplotlib inline
%matplotlib inline
```


```python
#run this cell without changes

# load the sample data 
no_queso = pickle.load(open("data/no_queso.pkl", "rb"))
queso = pickle.load(open("data/queso.pkl", "rb"))

# plot histograms

fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12, 4))

ax1.set_title('Sample of Non-Queso Check Totals')
ax1.set_xlabel('Amount')
ax1.set_ylabel('Frequency')
ax1.hist(no_queso, bins=20)

ax2.set_title('Sample of Queso Check Totals')
ax2.set_xlabel('Amount')
ax2.set_ylabel('Frequency')
ax2.hist(queso, bins=20)
plt.show()
```

### 1. Hypotheses and Errors

The restaurant owners want to know if customers who order queso spend **significantly more *or* significantly less** than customers who do not order queso.

#### 1a) Describe the null $H_{0}$ and alternative hypotheses $H_{A}$ for this test.


```python
# your written answer here
```

#### 1b) What does it mean to make `Type I` and `Type II` errors in this specific context?


```python
# your written answer here
```

### 2. Sample Testing

#### 2a) Run a statistical test on the two samples. Use a significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$. You can assume the two samples have equal variance. 

_Hint: Use `scipy.stats` (imported as `stats` above)._


```python
# your code here 
```

#### 2b) Can you reject the null hypothesis at a significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$?  

#### Why or why not?


```python
# your written answer here
```
