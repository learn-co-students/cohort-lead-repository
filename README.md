# Purpose

This repository contains lesson and practice materials for Flatiron School's data science program. 


### How to contribute

Clone this repository and create a new branch
```
git clone https://github.com/learn-co-students/cohort-lead-repository

git checkout -b <name of branch>
```
  
**The directory structure for each lesson is designed as follows:**
```
lesson-folder
    |
     -- index.ipynb
     -- .solution_files/
        |
         -- index.ipynb 
     -- data/
```

This directory structure can be created easily using the [dscreate](https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/dscreate) tool. 

**Once your lesson is completed,** 
1. **Please submit a pull request to merge your change into the *`curriculum branch`***, and assign the code review to a fellow data science cohort lead. 
2. Once your update has been merged into curriculum, open a pull request to merge into the `master` branch.
